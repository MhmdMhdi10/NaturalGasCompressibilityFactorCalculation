# NaturalGasCompressibilityFactorCalculation

This project estimates the compressibility factor (Z) for a dry natural gas sample at 5709 psig and 293Â°F. It includes:

    Importing gas composition from Excel

    Estimating C7+ critical properties

    Correcting pseudo-critical properties (Wichert-Aziz method)

    Calculating Z using:

        Peng-Robinson (PR) EOS

        Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) EOS

    Comparing results with Standing-Katz chart values (Dranchuk-Abou-Kassem correlation)

Built with Python for efficient thermodynamic modeling.
